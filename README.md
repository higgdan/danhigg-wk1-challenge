# danhigg-wk1-challenge

For the first weekly challenge I worked to refactor existing code for digital marketing agency, Horiseon. 

This involved fixing broken links; adding alt text to images for the purpose of accessability (eg. screen readers); consolidation of redundant code; and reordering of the code in a logical way, following semantic structure.

This editing of the existing code was not to change appearance of the webpage.
